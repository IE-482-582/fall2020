    ```
    
    - Does this file define a **message**, a **service**, or an **action**? Explain how you know your answer is correct.
        - *your answer goes here*


11. Consider the ROS Python node described below:
    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    
    # File: topic_publisher.py
    
    import rospy
    from std_msgs.msg import Int32
    
    rospy.init_node('topic_publisher')
    pub = rospy.Publisher('counter', Int32)
    rate = rospy.Rate(2)
    
    count = 0
    while not rospy.is_shutdown():
        pub.publish(count)
        count += 1
        rate.sleep()
    ```
    
    1. [*3 points*] How long does the code pause in the last line (`rate.sleep()`)?
        - *your answer goes here*

    2. [*3 points*] What is the name of the topic?
        - `your answer goes here`

    3. [*3 points*] What is the message type?
        - `your answer goes here`

	4. [*3 points*] What is the line of code in which the topic is actually published?
        - `your answer goes here`
	

12. [*6 points*] Consider the ROS Python node below: 
    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    
    # File: topic_subscriber.py
    import rospy
    from std_msgs.msg import Int32
    
    def callbk_reg(msg):
        print "Apple"
        # print msg.data
    
    def callbk_count(msg):
        print "Orange"
        # print msg.data
    
    rospy.init_node('topic_subscriber')
    
    print "Hey"
    sub1 = rospy.Subscriber('counter', Int32, callbk_count)
    
    print "Whoa"
    sub2 = rospy.Subscriber('register', Int32, callbk_reg)
    
    rospy.spin()
    ```
    Suppose that the following events occur:
    1. You start `roscore` in a terminal window.
    2.  You start the `topic_subscriber` node in a second (different) terminal window.
    3. You wait several seconds before starting a ROS node that publishes to the `counter` topic (in a third terminal window).
    4. Two (2) messages from the `counter` topic are received by the `topic_subscriber` node.   Assume that there are no messages broadcast on the `register` topic.
    5. You hit `Ctrl`-`C` in the second terminal window.

    What, exactly, is printed to the screen by the `topic_subscriber` node?

    ```
    your answer 
    goes here
    ```

	
13. Briefly explain the following ROS concepts:
    1. [*4 points*] "Node":
        - *your answer goes here*
					
    2. [*4 points*] "Topic": 
        - *your answer goes here*

    3. [*4 points*] "Service":
        - *your answer goes here*


14. [*6 points*] For each item below, specify whether a **Topic**, **Service**, or **Action** is most appropriate: 
    1. Simple request/response interactions, such as asking a question about a node's current state.
        - *your answer goes here*

    2. Most request/response interactions, especially when servicing the request is not instantaneous (e.g., navigating to a goal location).
        - *your answer goes here*

    3. One-way communication, especially if there might be multiple nodes listening (e.g., streams of sensor data).
        - *your answer goes here*


15. [*5 points*] **True** or **False**:  A node can either be a publisher or a subscriber, but not both.
    - *your answer goes here*


16. [*5 points*] **True** or **False**:  A single node can publish to multiple topics.
    - *your answer goes here*


17. [*5 points*] **True** or **False**:  A single node can subscribe to multiple topics.
    - *your answer goes here*



18. [*5 points*] Consider the following information copied from the terminal:
    ```
    student@vm:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make
        Base path: /home/student/catkin_ws
        Source space: /home/student/catkin_ws/src
        Build space: /home/student/catkin_ws/build
        Devel space: /home/student/catkin_ws/devel
        Install space: /home/student/catkin_ws/install
        Error(s) in package '/home/student/catkin_ws/src/custom_message/package.xml':
        Error(s):
        - The manifest (with format version 2) must not contain the following tags: run_depend
    ```
    - What was the problem?  How do you fix the problem?	
        - *your answer goes here*

19. Suppose we have a package named `something_new`.  Furthermore, suppose we have a message-definition file, named `my_message.msg`, that contains the following:
    ```
    int32 someNumber
    float32 anotherNumber
    string someTest
    ```

    Now, imagine we are writing a ROS node (a Python script) that will **subscribe** to a topic named `noise`, such that this topic is of the `my_message` type.

    1. [*4 points*] Write the single line of Python code that will import our custom message type.
        ```
        your answer goes here
        ```

    2. [*4 points*] Write the single line of Python code that will subscribe to the `noise` topic.  A callback function named `noiseCallback` should be called whenever a message is published to the `noise` topic.
        ```
        your answer goes here
        ```

    Next, suppose we have a ROS node that **publishes** to the `noise` topic.

    1. [*4 points*] Write the single line of Python code that will define the publisher for the `noise` topic.  Use a queue size of 5.  
        ```
        your answer goes here
        ```

    2. [*4 points*] Write a single line of code that will initialize an empty message of type `my_message`.
        ```
        your answer goes here
        ```
    
    3. [*4 points*] Write a single line of code that will initialize the value of `someNumber`, associated with the message type `my_message`, such that `someNumber` equals `3.14`.
        ```
        your answer goes here
        ```
    
    4. [*4 points*] Write a single line of code that will publish to the `noise` topic.
        ```
        your answer goes here
        ```
    

20. [*5 points*] Consider the following Python code:

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import rospy
    
    isMoving = True
    changeTime = rospy.Time.now() + rospy.Duration(5)
    rate = rospy.Rate(1)
    
    while not rospy.is_shutdown():
        print(isMoving)
        if (rospy.Time.now() >= changeTime):
            isMoving = not isMoving
            changeTime = rospy.Time(now) + rospy.Duration(5)
        rate.sleep()
	```
	
    What is the value of `isMoving` 33 seconds after you start running this script?  
    - `your answer goes here`

    
21. [*10 points*] Suppose we have a ROS package, named `math_service` that implements a simple service.  The client will provide two numbers; the service will return the value of those two numbers multiplied by each other.

    The server node runs in a script named `server.py`.  The code for this node is shown here:

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    # File:  ~/catkin_ws/src/math_service/scripts/server.py

    import rospy    
    from math_service.srv import simple_math
    
    def handle_multiply(request):
        return {'c': request.a * request.b}
    	
    rospy.init_node('server')
    
    s = rospy.Service('multiply', simple_math, handle_multiply)
    
    rospy.spin()
    ```	

    The package uses a custom service type named `simple_math.srv`.  The code specifying the structure of this service is shown here:	
    ```	
    # File: ~/catkin_ws/src/math_service/srv/simple_math.srv
    float32 a
    float32 b
    ---
    float32 c
    ```

    Your task is to edit the client node code below, such that it will call the service and print out the response.  You will need to write two lines of code to make the client node function properly.  Simply edit the code below, as per the instructions in the UPPER CASE comments:
    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    # File:  ~/catkin_ws/src/math_service/scripts/client.py

    import rospy
    from math_service.srv import simple_math
    
    # Define two numbers that we want to multiply:
    number1 = 32.3
    number2 = 49.1
    
    rospy.init_node('client')
    
    rospy.wait_for_service('multiply')
    
    call_multiply = rospy.ServiceProxy('multiply', simple_math)
    
    
    # 1) WRITE ONE LINE OF CODE HERE THAT PROVIDES THE SERVICE WITH THE
    # TWO NUMBERS WE WANT TO MULTIPLY, AND CAPTURES A RESPONSE.
    
    
    # 2) WRITE ONE LINE OF CODE HERE THAT PRINTS THE SERVICE RESPONSE
    # (WHICH IS THE RESULT OF MULTIPLYING OUR TWO NUMBERS).
    ```
